Once you've [installed Chorus](./installation), it's time to create your first chat.

When you open Chorus for the first time, you'll see a new chat window. You can always get back here by clicking the "New Chat" button in the top left or by pressing <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>.

### Adding or changing models

Click on "Claude Sonnet 4" (or press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>) to change the model you're chatting with.

In Chorus, you can select multiple models and they'll all respond to your message at once.

Try selecting `Claude Sonnet 4` and `Gemini 2.5 Flash`, and then send a follow-up question, like "Which tools can I use with Chorus?"

### Tools

Give the AIs access to a tool by clicking the `Tools` label (or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>). When a tool is enabled, the AI can optionally use it to answer your question.

Try enabling the `web` tool, then send a follow-up question, like "What's the weather like in San Francisco today?"

### Attachments

Add an attachment by dragging and dropping it into the chat, or by pressing the paperclip icon to open the file picker. Chorus can read PDFs, images, and text documents.

If you paste a link into the chat, Chorus will automatically read the webpage.
