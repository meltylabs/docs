## What data do we use?

We don’t look at your chats, and we don’t want to. Your chats are between you and your AI. We make money from a subscription rather than selling your data.
We ask model providers like OpenAI and Anthropic not to train their models on your data.

We do collect analytics data, like what features you use, crash logs, etc. This helps us fix bugs and learn what parts of Chorus to improve.

## Where do you store my chats?

Your chat history is saved locally in the Application Support directory `~/Library/Application\ Support/sh.chorus.app`. None of it is stored on our servers.

## What types of data does Chorus collect?

Most app data is stored locally on your computer in the Application Support directory.
Here's what we store elsewhere.
In an encrypted Postgres database served by Fly, we store
- Your account data (such as your email address and plan)
- Message metadata (such as creation time, which model it was sent to, length, number of tokens)

We store analytics data in [PostHog](https://posthog.com) when an event occurs in the app, such as
- You create a chat, select a model, or send a message (including metadata like which model was involved and which app features you’re using)
- A model decides to use a tool (including the name of the tool)
- A model provider returns an error (including the error message)
- You apply a revision (including which model generated it)
- An unexpected error occurs (including the error message and stack trace)

<Note>
If you're on the Enterprise plan, we can toggle analytics off. Just email us at [founders@chorus.sh](mailto:founders@chorus.sh).
</Note>

PostHog stores data about your computer, like your OS and IP address.
We don't capture or store any session recordings.

## What data do the model providers collect? Are my messages used for training?

Where possible, we ask model providers not to train their models on your data. You can find the privacy policies of our main model providers here:
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/)
- [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/legal/privacy)
- [Gemini](https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961?hl=en#privacy_notice)
- [xAI](https://x.ai/legal/privacy-policy)
- [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/privacy)

## How does Ambient Chat work? Can it see my screen at all times?

Chorus can only see your screen if you explicitly grant screen-recording permissions in your Mac’s Privacy & Security settinsg.
Even once you grant screen-recording permissions, Chorus only captures your screen when you turn on “Vision Mode.” Whenever Vision Mode is enabled, you'll see a big orange indicator.
If you’ve granted screen-recording permissions and enabled vision mode, then whenever you send a message, Chorus will take a screenshot of your entire screen and send it to the model provider. The screenshot is not stored on our servers.
When Vision Mode is disabled, no screenshots are created.

## Is my data encrypted? Who can access my data?

Any data we store (like your email and message metadata) is encrypted in a Fly Postgres database or on PostHog’s servers (both SOC 2 compliant). It can be accessed only by Melty employees.
