Ambient Chat lets you chat anywhere on your Mac with an AI that can see your screen.


## Configure the shortcut

By default, Ambient Chat opens with <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>, but you can change it to any shortcut you like.

Open settings with <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>,</kbd>, or by clicking the settings icon in the bottom of the sidebar, and go to the "Ambient Chat" section.

## Vision Mode

Vision mode includes a screenshot of your screen every time you send a message, and is OFF by default.

To enable it, press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> while Ambient Chat is open. You'll see the eye open.

## How to get the best of Ambient Chat

We find that Ambient Chat works best for quick questions while you're working in other apps. 


Questions like:
- How can I translate this hsl color into hex?
- what apsect ratio is 1200x630
- what is git bisecting
- how do I fix this error? [vision mode on]

Vision Mode works great for helping me learn tools I don't know well (how do I add a section in this Framer page?) or for converting visuals into structured text (can you turn this chart into a csv?).

When you want to have a more substantial conversaion, open the chat in the main window by pressing <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>O</kbd> or clicking the "Open Chat" button at the top of the Ambient Chat window.

Here's one more piece of inspiration from one of our users:

> I decided to use Chorus as I read through a new research paper. This time, I felt the value of Chorus significantly more. Being able to chat with the LLM and research into specific elements of the paper without needing to copy and paste or change tabs was a fluid experience. The minimal UI of the ambient window blended in perfectly and didn't distract me from my reading.
