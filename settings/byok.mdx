Chorus lets you bring your own API keys to use any of the AI providers at your own cost. When you add a custom API key, we'll use that when calling the AI provider.

To use your own API keys, go `Settings` > `API Keys` and add your API key.

Your API key will be stored locally on your computer and are completely private.
