When you start a new chat you often need to re-use context. Things like code snippets, design notes, PDFS, company specific information, etc. Instead of copying that material over each time, Chorus lets you store it in one central place——a Project.


## Sharing Context in Projects 

[Projects](../core/projects) are a feature in Chorus that allow you to group similar chats together. 

To create a project in Chorus, press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> or click the "New Project" button in the sidebar.

On the project page, put any _shared_ information in the `Context` field that you want all chats in your project to automatically have access to.

### Using Project Memory 

But what if you discover something while working on a chat _in_ a Project and want to make sure other chats can see it? 

When you toggle **Project Memory** on from the projects page, Chorus will automatically generate a short transcript of each of your chats in that project. 

These transcripts will be made available to all other chats. 

So next time you make that key discovery, or the AI nails the plan you've been looking for, all of your other chats will be sure to know about it.
