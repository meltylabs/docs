There will inevitably come a time when you have to find an old chat, copy some old text, and paste it into a new chat. 

You might have to do this tens, or even hundreds of times, so that your new chat has some baseline knowledge to go off of. 

Thankfully, in Chorus, there's a better way. 

## Sharing Context in Projects 

[Projects](../core/projects) are a feature in Chorus that allow you to group similar chats together. 

To create a project in Chorus, press <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> or click the "New Project" button in the sidebar.

On the project page, put any _shared_ information in the `Context` field that you want all chats in your project to automatically have access to.

### Using Project Memory 

But what if you discover something while working on a chat _in_ a Project and want to make sure other chats can see it? 

When you toggle **Project Memory** on from the projects page, Chorus will automatically generate a short transcript of each of your chats in that project. 

These transcripts will be made available to all other chats. 

So next time you make that key discovery, or the AI nails the plan you've been looking for, all of your other chats will be sure to know about it.
