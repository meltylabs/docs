[Ambient Chat](../core/ambient-chat) captures a live snapshot of your screen each time you send a message, so the assistant can answer with full awareness of whatever is in front of you—like it's watching over your shoulder.


## How to Use Ambient Chat 

To create a new Ambient Chat, first press <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>. This shortcut will work from anywhere on your Mac. 

Next, press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd> to enable vision mode to share your screen with Chorus. 

<Note>
  You'll need to grant Chorus permission to access your screen to use Vision Mode.
</Note>

Now, every time you send a message in Ambient Chat, Chorus will take a screenshot of your screen and share it with the AI, and it can provide in-context answers relevant to what you're currently working on.
