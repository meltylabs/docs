## Style guidelines

-   Capitalize "Chorus" and "Ambient Chat". Lowercase "vision mode".
-   In section headings, use sentence case (e.g., "Managing your context window")
-   To keep section headings short, don't use "How to" (e.g., "Managing your context window" rather than "How to manage your context window")
-   Prefer simple language
-   Avoid abstract nouns ("You might use a project for" rather than "Some example use cases of projects are")
-   Prefer "Press X" or "Try pressing X" to "Let's press X"
-   Use "Chorus's" as a possessive (e.g., "Chorus's UI")

## Standard terms

-   Model picker
-   Tools picker
-   Command palette
-   Ambient Chat
-   Vision mode
-   Message composer

## Terms to avoid

-   "Context" (prefer "information," unless "context" is used to refer to the project context field or to a model's context window)
