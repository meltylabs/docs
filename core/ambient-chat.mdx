## When to Use Ambient Chat 

Ambient chat is a great way to get quick answers to questions while you're working in other apps. It's especially useful if you want to quickly share your screen with an AI.

Here's a piece of inspiration from one of our users:

> I decided to use Chorus as I read through a new research paper. This time, I felt the value of Chorus significantly more. Being able to chat with the LLM and research into specific elements of the paper without needing to copy and paste or change tabs was a fluid experience. The minimal UI of the ambient window blended in perfectly and didn't distract me from my reading. 

And here's a short video on how we use Ambient Chat at Chorus:
