Ambient chat gets you quick answers while you're working in other apps. It's especially useful if you want to quickly share your screen with an AI.

To create a new Ambient Chat, press <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Space</kbd>.

Here's how one Chorus user makes use of Ambient Chat:

> I decided to use Chorus as I read through a new research paper. [...] Being able to chat with the LLM and research into specific elements of the paper without needing to copy and paste or change tabs was a fluid experience. The minimal UI of the ambient window blended in perfectly and didn't distract me from my reading.

## Sharing your screen

Vision mode lets Chorus see your screen, by including a screenshot of your screen
every time you send a message.

Vision mode is OFF by default. To enable vision mode, press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>I</kbd>. You'll see the eye open, and this indicator will appear:

If you want to use vision mode, you'll need to grant Chorus screen-recording
permissions. Vision mode is totally optional.
