Projects are a way to share context between chats. 

Project development, company documentation, research, or even just a collection of files you want to keep together are all great fits for projects.

Give it a name and add whatever you'd like to the `Context` field, including images, files, or URLs. You can also click on our suggested prompts to get a feel for what you can do with projects.


## Drag and drop

It's really easy to add or remove chats from a project. Just drag and drop them in the sidebar.

## Project memory

Project memory is a powerful, unique feature in Chorus. When Project memory is on, the AI will *automatically learn* from all chats in the project. It gets smarter and more helpful each time you use it.

Let’s say you start a project for your personal finances, and you drag in a chat about your taxes. Now, when you start a new chat to work on budgeting, Chorus will automatically remember key information from your taxes chat. No need to copy–paste or re-explain!
