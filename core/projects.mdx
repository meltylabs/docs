## When to Use Projects 

Projects are useful for grouping together chats with related context that you don't want to re-state each time you chat. Some example use cases are: 

- Project development
- Company documentation
- Personal finance

Here's a short video on how we use projects at Chorus:

## Creating Your First Project 
To create a project in Chorus, press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> or click the "New Project" button in the sidebar.

First, give your project a title - this is for your own reference. 

Next, fill out the `Context` field; anything you write here will be automatically added to the context of each chat in your project. You can also drag and drop images, files, or URLs into the `Context` field.

And that's all! Press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> to create a new chat in your project and start chatting.

## Project Features 

### Drag and drop

If you need to add or remove chats from a project, simply drag and drop them in the sidebar!

### Project Memory 

When Project Memory is on, each new chat you create will automatically include the context of all previous chats in the project. This means that the AI will **automatically learn** from all chats in the project.

When you enable Project Memory, each time you chat in a Project, Chorus will generate a summary of that chat, which will then be **automatically shared** with all other chats in the project.

For example, let’s say you start a project for your personal finances, and you drag in a chat about your taxes. Now, when you start a new chat to work on budgeting, Chorus will automatically remember key information from your taxes chat. No need to copy–paste or re-explain!
