## When to Use Projects 

Projects are useful for grouping together chats with related context that you don't want to re-state each time. Some example use cases are: 

- Financial planning 
- Deep-diving a new topic
- Product development 

Here's a short video on how we use projects at Chorus:

## How to Create a Project 
To create a project in Chorus, press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> or click the "New Project" button in the sidebar.

First, give your project a title - this is for your own reference. 

Next, fill out the `Context` field; anything you write here will be automatically added to the context of each chat in your project. You can also drag and drop images, files, or URLs into the `Context` field.

And that's all! Press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> to create a new chat in your project and start chatting.

### How to Add a Chat to a Project 

If you need to add (or remove) chats in a project, simply drag and drop them in the sidebar!

### How to Share Context in a Project 

There are two ways to share context in a project: 

1. **Explicit Context** - Any text you write in the `Context` field of your project page will automatically be added to the context of each chat in your project.
2. **Project Memory** - You can also enable Project Memory, which automatically generates a summary of each chat in the project, and then **shares** that summary with all other chats in the project.

#### Context 

The `Context` field is a great place to add any explicit instructions or context that you want to share with _all_ of the chats in the project.

#### Project Memory 

Let’s say you start a project for your personal finances, and you drag in a chat about your taxes. Now, when you start a new chat to work on budgeting, Chorus will automatically remember key information from your taxes chat. No need to copy–paste or re-explain!
