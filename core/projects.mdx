Projects help you share information across chats. You might use a project for

-   Financial planning
-   Learning a language
-   Designing a product

There are two ways to share information in a project:

**Context** - Anything you put in the `Context` field of your project page will automatically be added to each chat in the project.
For example, in a financial planning project, you might add your tax returns to the project context so that they're visible to all chats.

**Project Memory** - If you enable project memory, Chorus will automatically extract key information from each chat in the project to share with all the other chats.
For example, when you have project memory enabled, if you add your tax returns to one chat, when you start a new chat, Chorus will automatically remember the key parts.

## Creating a project

To create a project in Chorus, press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> or click the "New Project" button in the sidebar.

First, give your project a title. This is for your own reference.

Fill out the `Context` field. Anything you write here will be automatically added to each chat in your project. You can also drag in PDFS, images, or text files, or paste links.

Here's an example of a `Context` field that we use at Chorus:

```text Project Context Example
You are a pair programmer working helping with app, Chorus. Please use the terminal tool to read my files alongside me. My codebase is in ~/Developer/melty/chorus. 

It's built in Tauri 2.0 and Typescript. The API is an Elixir Phoenix app and it's in ~/Develper/melty/api.

Please ask technical questions about my architecture, database queries, and infrastructure to diagnose any issues.
```


If you want chats to automatically share information with each other, turn on project memory.

## Memory

Project memory is a feature that allows you to share information across chats in a project. When you enable project memory, Chorus will automatically extract key information from each chat in the project to share with all the other chats.

## Starting a chat

Press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd> to create a new chat in your project. You can also find the project in the sidebar and click the plus button next to its name.

## Moving a chat into a project
