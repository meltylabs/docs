## What are Tools? 


Tools are a powerful way to extend AI's abilities.

They allow AI models to perform actions like searching the web, running terminal commands, or interacting with APIs. 

In Chorus, tools are analogous to **MCPs**.

Out of the box, Chorus has access to:

- Web: search the web for information
- Terminal: run terminal commands
- Image Generator: generate images with `gpt-image-1`
- GitHub: manage repos, code, issues, and PRs

## When to Use Tools 

Use tools when you want the AI to have access to external data or APIs. For example, searching the web for current stock prices, pulling in data from a third-party like Stripe, or reading a local file. 

We're constantly experimenting with tool usage at Chorus. Here's a short video with more on how we use them: 

For example, you can use the `Web` and `Terminal` tools in combination to search the web and download information.

Or the `GitHub` tool to manage your GitHub repos, code, issues, and PRs:

Or the `replicate` custom MCP to generate images:

## How to Use Tools

To use tools in a chat, simply click the `Tools` button in the message composer, or press <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> to open the tool selector.

From there, you can select the tool(s) you'd like to enable. 

<Note>
    Just because a tool is available doesn't mean it will be used. The AI will only use tools if it feels it's necessary to do so.

### How to Integrate Custom Tools / Local or Remote MCPs 

MCPs are easy to add to Chorus. Here's a demo:

<video src="https://meltylabs.fly.storage.tigris.dev/ChorusMCP.mp4" controls alt="Add Custom MCP" />

Select the `Add Custom MCP` button in the tools picker or go to `Settings` -> `Connections` to manage your MCPs.

You can also add a custom **local** or **remote** MCP to Chorus by clicking `Add Remote MCP` or `Add Local MCP` in settings. 

Once you follow the on-screen prompts, you'll be able to run your custom MCP. 

<Note>
    If you're using a remote MCP, you'll need to run `mcp-remote` locally to form a connection for Chorus to use. 
    You can find the `mcp-remote` binary in the `mcp-remote` directory of your Chorus installation.
