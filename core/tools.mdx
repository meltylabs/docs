## When to Use Tools 

In Chorus, **tools** are features that extend the AI's capabilities beyond just text generation. They allow AI models to perform actions like searching the web, running terminal commands, or interacting with APIs. 

You should reach for tools in Chorus when you anticipate the AI needing to take actions beyond just text generation - searching the web for up to date information, getting data from a third-party, or reading a local file, for example. 

We're constantly experimenting with tool usage at Chorus. Here's a short video with more on how we use them:

## How to Use Tools 

To use tools in a chat, simply press <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> to open the tool selector.

From there, you can select the tool(s) you'd like to enable. 

<Note>
    Just because a tool is available doesn't mean it will be used. The AI will only use tools if it feels it's necessary to do so.

## Tool Features 

## Built-in Tools 

Chorus comes with a few built-in tools that you will always see in the UI, such as web search and terminal access. 

## Custom Tools 

You can add a custom tool to Chorus by selecting `Add Custom MCP` from the tools picker, or by going to `Settings` -> `Connections`. 

At this point, we should that **tools** are Chorus's way of presenting **MCPs**. You can add a custom **local** or **remote** MCP to Chorus
by using the `Add Local|Remote MCP` button in the `Connections` section of the settings.

Once you follow the on-screen prompts, you'll be able to run the MCP.
