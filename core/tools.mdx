Tools allow AI models to perform actions like searching the web, reading Slack messages, or sending emails.

Out of the box, Chorus has access to these sets of tools:

-   Web: search the web for information
-   Terminal: run terminal commands
-   Image Generator: generate images with OpenAI's `gpt-image-1` model
-   GitHub: manage repos, code, issues, and PRs

To use tools in a chat, click the `Tools` button in the message composer, or press <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> to open the tool selector.

Toggle on any tools you'd like to use. When the light turns green, the tools are ready.

<Note>
    Even if a tool is available, the AI might decide not to use it. You can
    always include instructions in your message like "Use the web tools" or
    "Don't use any tools."
</Note>

You can also add your own tools through [MCP servers](./mcp).

## Examples

Use the `Web` and `Terminal` tools in combination to search the web and download information:
