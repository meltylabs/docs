## What are Tools? 

Tools are, simply, a gamechanger for how you use AI. 

They allow AI models to perform actions like searching the web, running terminal commands, or interacting with APIs. 

In Chorus, tools are analogous to **MCPs**. 

## When to Use Tools 

If it feels like you need access to data outside of what the AI already knows, reach for tools. For example, searching the web for current stock prices, pulling in data from a third-party like Stripe, or reading a local file. 

We're constantly experimenting with tool usage at Chorus. Here's a short video with more on how we use them:

## How to Use Tools 

To use tools in a chat, simply click the `Tools` button in the message composer, or press <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd> to open the tool selector.

From there, you can select the tool(s) you'd like to enable. 

<Note>
    Just because a tool is available doesn't mean it will be used. The AI will only use tools if it feels it's necessary to do so.

### How to Enable More Tools 

Chorus comes with a few built-in tools that can enable by selecting the `Add Built-in MCP` button in the tools picker or by going to `Settings` -> `Connections`.

These tools require little to not setup to get started with.

### How to Integrate Custom Tools 

You can also add a custom **local** or **remote** MCP to Chorus by clicking `Add Remote MCP` or `Add Local MCP` in settings. 

Once you follow the on-screen prompts, you'll be able to run your custom MCP. 

<Note>
    If you're using a remote MCP, you'll need to run `mcp-remote` locally to form a connection for Chorus to use. 
    You can find the `mcp-remote` binary in the `mcp-remote` directory of your Chorus installation.
