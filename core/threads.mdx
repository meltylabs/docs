Threads are useful for asking follow-up questions, or to tweak a particular model response. 

## Creating a thread

<img src="/images/new-reply-light.png" alt="New Reply" className="dark:hidden" />
<img src="/images/new-reply-dark.png" alt="New Reply" className="hidden dark:block" />

To start a thread, click the reply icon in the top right of a message. 

This will open up a thread on the right side of the screen, which can be resized by clicking and dragging on the divider between the main chat window and the thread.

## Isolated Context 

When you reply to a model, any messages exchanged are _not_ shared with the main chat, so future rounds of conversation are unaware of your reply thread. 

This makes threads are a great place to ask follow-up questions without worrying about the models in the main chat being influenced by your replies. 

## Example

Here's a short video on how we use threads at Chorus:
