Using multiple models at once can help you collect different perspectives, spot mistakes and hallucinations, and gain confidence.

To use multiple models in a chat, press <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> to bring up the model picker, and click on whichever models you want to use.

When you send your next message, the selected models will respond.

## Adding a model to an existing message

You can add a model to respond to a message you already sent by clicking the `Add` button in the row of responses:

## Sending follow-up messages

When you send a follow-up message, the models will respond to the messages that are `In Chat` (highlighted with an orange border).

By default, the leftmost response will be marked as `In Chat`. To mark a different response as `In Chat`, click on that response.

## Changing the order of responses

To change the order the responses will show up in, you can rearrange the models in the model picker:
