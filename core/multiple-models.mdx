## When to Use Multiple Models 

One of Chorus's core features is the ability to have multiple models respond to your messages. This also allows you to gather a variety of opinions and perspectives in response to a single message, while also reducing the risk of single point of failure hallucinations. 

At Chorus, our staff almost always uses multiple models in a single chat. Here's a short video with more on how we use multiple models:

You can also re-arrange the order of the models by drag and dropping the pills at the top of the dialog.
