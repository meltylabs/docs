Using multiple models at once can help you collect different perspectives, spot mistakes and hallucinations, and gain confidence.

To use multiple models in a chat, press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> to bring up the model picker, and click on whichever models you want to use.

When you send your next message, the selected models will respond.

## Adding a model to an existing message

You can add a model to respond to a message you already sent by clicking the `Add` button in the row of responses:

## Sending follow-up messages

When you send a follow-up message, the models will respond to the messages that are `In Chat` (highlighted with an orange border).

By default, the leftmost response will be marked as `In Chat`. To mark a different response as `In Chat`, click on that response.

## Changing the order of responses

To change the order the responses will show up in, you can rearrange the models in the model picker:

## Using multiple instances of the same model

You can chat with multiple instances of the same model by creating custom prompts. This allows you to get different perspectives from the same model.

To set up multiple instances:

1. Press <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd> to open the custom prompts page
2. Pick the model you want to use multiple times
3. Give it a new name (e.g., "sonnet-b", "sonnet-c", "sonnet-d")
4. Save your custom prompt

<img

    class="rounded-lg"
    alt="Creating a custom prompt"
/>

Repeat as many times as you want.

Once you've created a few custom prompts, you can select them in the model picker just like regular models:

    class="rounded-lg"
    alt="Model picker with custom prompts"
/>

When you send a message, each instance will respond independently:

    class="rounded-lg"
    alt="Multiple instances responding"
/>
