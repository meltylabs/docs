## When to Use Multiple Models 

In Chorus, you can configure multiple models to respond to your messages. This enables you to gather a variety of opinions and perspectives in response to a single message, while also reducing the effects of a single model hallucinating. 

At Chorus, our staff almost always uses multiple models in a single chat. Here's a short video with more on how we use multiple models:

## How to Use Multiple Models 

To use multiple models in a chat, simply click the model names in the message composer, or press <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> to open the model selector.

From there, you can select as many models as you'd like to respond to your message - there's no limit.

You can also re-arrange the order of the models by drag and dropping the pills at the top of the dialog.

If you've already sent a message, you can add a model to respond to your existing message by clicking the `Add` button in the row of responses.

### How to Manage Your Chat Context 

One natural question is what happens to the chat context when you have multiple models responding to your message. 

In Chorus, you can select which response is `In Chat`, meaning it will be added to the chat context. Future rounds of conversation will be able to see only the answer you selected. 

By default, responses from the first model you selected will be marked as `In Chat`. To mark a different response as `In Chat`, simply click on that response's box.
