Replies are useful for asking follow-up questions, or to tweak a particular model response. 

## Creating a reply

To reply to a model response, click the reply icon in the top right of a message. 

This will open up a reply thread on the right side of the screen, which can be resized by clicking and dragging on the divider between the main chat window and the reply thread.

## Isolated Context 

When you reply to a model, any messages exchanged are _not_ shared with the main chat, so future rounds of conversation are unaware of your reply thread. 

This makes replies are a great place to ask follow-up questions without worrying about the models in the main chat being influenced by your replies. 

## Example

Here's a short video on how we use replies at Chorus:
