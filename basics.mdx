## Your First Chat
Now that you've [installed Chorus](./installation), let's create your first chat. 

When you open Chorus for the first time, you'll see a new chat window. You can always get back here by clicking the "New Chat" button in the top left or by pressing <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>.

First, click the model name (or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>) to change the model you're chatting with. In Chorus, you can select multiple models and they'll all respond to your message at once. For this example, select `Claude Sonnet 4` and `Gemini 2.5 Flash`. 

Then, give the AIs access to a tool by clicking the `Tools` label (or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>). When a tool is enabled, the AI can optionally use it to answer your question. For this example, enable the `Web` tool. 

Optionally, add an attachment by dragging and dropping them into the chat or by pressing the paperclip icon to open the file picker. Chorus can read PDFs, images, and even URLs.

Now you're ready to chat! Type your message and press enter. The AIs will respond to your message.
