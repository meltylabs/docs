## Overview
Chorus is a native Mac app for chatting with all the AIs. It's fast, keyboard shortcut friendly, and lets you chat with multiple AIs at once. 

No need to switch between ChatGPT, Claude, or AI Studio to try the latest models——Chorus gives you one app for all the AIs.

Chorus is packed with features:
- [Local models](./essentials/local)
- [Projects](./essentials/projects)
- [Ambient Chat](./essentials/ambient-chat)
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Bring your own API keys
- MCP support


## Your First Chat
Once you've [installed Chorus](./installation), create your first chat by pressing <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>N</kbd>.
You'll see a new chat window open.

Click the model name (or <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd>) to change the model. You can select multiple models at once, and they'll all respond to your message.

You can also give the AIs access to tools by pressing <kbd>⌘</kbd> + <kbd>T</kbd>. When a tool is enabled, the AI will be able to use it to answer your question. We recommend keeping **only enabling the tools you need**, and disabling them otherwise. If the AI has too many tools enabled, it may get confused.

To add attachments, drag and drop them into the chat or press the paperclip icon to open the file picker. Chorus can read PDFs, images, and even URLs.
